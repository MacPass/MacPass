#MacPass

There are a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X version.
KeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.

MacPass is an attempt to create a native OS X port of KeePass.

##Disclaimer
The Project is in heavy development. Beware that I'm going to shift things around so stuff is going to break. A lot.

##Download

Since Github now provides a release feature, I'm trying to upload binaries for all the tags I create along the way.
Use it with caution, it's unfinished. Really!

All releases can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases).

If you want to live dangerously and want to take a look at the master:

    git clone https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass
    cd MacPass
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

After that you can build and run in Xcode. If you run into signing issues take a look at [Issue #92](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/issues/92)

##Known Major Issues

* Binary releases (0.2.x - 0.3.x):
  * KDBX DeletedObjects are stripped on save. This will break synchronisation features!
* Binary releases (since 0.4.x):
  * KDBX History is only preseverd. Editting doesn't create new history entries
  * Default Autotype Sequences will get stored although they shouldn't be stored
  * Default Autotype sequence is wrong ````{TAB}{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}```` instead of ````{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}````
  
##System Requirement

The minimum OS X version required for MacPass is currently 10.8 Mountain Lion.
Since 10.9 Mavericks is a free upgrade I have no plans to support 10.7 Lion.

##Status

The Status can be found on the dedicated [Wiki page](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Status).

##What does it look like?

##Alternatives

[KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org) is a Qt based KeePass port. The stable 0.4.3 release only supports the version 1 format. The Alpha can read database version 1 and 2 and write version 2 containers rather nicely.
It's in active development and open source. Since Alpha 4 the random password generator has found it's way back into the Alpha releases, version 0.4.3 includes one as well. The Alpha fully supports all database 2 features and should be stable enough for daily usage. It can import version 1 into a version 2 file but is unable to natively write version 1 files.

[KyPass Companion](http://www.kyuran.be/logiciels/kypass4mac/) is a native Cocoa port and offers KeePassHttp compatiblity.
Should be able to read and write database version 1 and 2. It is closed source and currently available in the Mac App Store. It's rather expensive considering the bugs and missing features. Based on the user reviews it should work. Not all version 2 features are supported. It is unable to convert between database versions.

[S3crets](http://s3crets.com/en/help/) native Cocoa Port with a different approach to displaying the database fully inside a tree.
It is able to read and write database version 1 and 2. Not all database features are fully supported.
