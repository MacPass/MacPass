MacPass
=======

There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.
KeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.

This is an attempt to create an OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.

Alternatives
------------

Currently there is an alpha Version available of [KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org).
It's Qt based KeePass manager, than can handle KeePass 1 and 2 containers rather nicely.
Compared to running KeePass with Mono it very fast and remarkably stable for an alpha relaese.
Feel free to give it a try.

What does it look like?
