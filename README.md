MacPass
=======

There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.
KeePass can be used as is via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality.

This is an attemtp to create amn OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.
Editing and synching capabilities might get added in the future.
