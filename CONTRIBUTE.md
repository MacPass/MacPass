## Translations
MacPass has translations for a few languages. If you can translate to another language, or you think a translation is wrong, follow the next steps to add or improve a translation:
- You can use a XLIFF editor for translating the strings. For example [XLIFFTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xlifftool/id1074282695)
- For a new localization only:
  - Select MacPass in the project navigator
  - Select the MacPass project in the project and targets list
  - Open the info tab and click the `+` button un the localizations section.
  - Choose the language you want to translate
  - Select all resources and click finish, now the new language is available for export in the next step
- Export the XLIFF file
  - Select the MacPass project in XCode
  - Go to `Editor -> Export for Localization`
  - Select the language you want to translate
- Now use your XLIFF editor and save the file if you are done with your translations
- Go back to XCode and use `Editor -> Import Localization` to import the changes
